  description: |
    After helping millions of Android users get access to the sites they love, we have launched the first official Psiphon app for iOS!

    Psiphon is the most robust circumvention tool on the web. Psiphon Browser will connect you to websites that are censored, blocked, or otherwise unavailable, no matter where you are in the world. Using Psiphon Browser also provides you with an extra layer of protection when using public Wi-Fi services.

    Psiphon is the best tool for accessing the open Internet.

    Features:
    • Free for personal use.
    • Easy to download and install. No registration or configuration required.
    • Automatic selection of protocols to provide effective, reliable circumvention every time.
    • Psiphon is an open-source project subject to credible security auditing and open review. To find our source code and more information, visit the project homepage: https://github.com/Psiphon-Inc/endless
