  description: |
    After helping tens of millions of users in the world's most hostile environments get access to the sites they love, Psiphon has launched our first official app for iOS!  Our new browser app seamlessly integrates access to the Psiphon circumvention network, securely connecting you to your sites.

    Psiphon is the most robust circumvention tool on the web. The Psiphon Browser app will connect you to websites that are censored, blocked, or otherwise unavailable, no matter where you are in the world. The app also provides you with an extra layer of protection when using public wi-fi services or other networks that could be untrustworthy.

    Key features include:
    • Free, unlimited personal use.
    • Easy to download, install, and use. No registration or configuration required.
    • Multiple language support and configurable server location.
    • Automatic selection of protocols to provide fast, reliable circumvention, every time.
